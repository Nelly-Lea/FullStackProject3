## Description

This project is a website designed to manage a guest list for an event. The site allows users to create an account, log in, and then add, delete, modify the number of guests, and update their status (if there are coming to the event or not). Additionally, it automatically displays the total number of guests.

## Goals and Features of this Project

- End-to-end website comprising both client and server components.  
- Utilization of Single Page Application (SPA) architecture for the client-side.  
- Data storage implemented in the local storage.  
- Access to the database is only through the server using the DB API.  
- Server-client communication through FAJAX simulations  
- REST_API operations in JSON format
